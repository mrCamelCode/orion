     * method on the underlying HTTP server, which is all Deno API. Aborting
     * doesn't seem to give me the hanging issue, so I assume there's something
     * wonky with the attempt at a graceful shutdown. Aborting is fine (the
     * LobbyServer cleans itself up pretty well and logs and whatnot), so I don't
     * necessarily need the graceful shutdown.
     *
     * There are some issues (like [this one](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/22387))
     * that may potentially be part of the issue? I notice the `serverWebSocket`
     * resource hangs around longer than it probably should, even though I'm
     * closing all the sockets as I'm able. The bug may be fixed with Deno 2, but
     * currently on Deno 1.43.6, it appears to be bugged, so we'll use `abort`
     * for the time being.
